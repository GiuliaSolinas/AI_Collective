# Sustainability for generative AI 

Sustainability for generative AI is an overlooked yet important topic. Estimates from 2022 from an unpublished research paper from Hugging Face are here at this [MIT news article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/14/1063192/were-getting-a-better-idea-of-ais-true-carbon-footprint/). On the positive side, as of 2025 we have extremly efficient chips and more powerfull processors that can help mitigate the problems--see news from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/04/26/the-untold-story-of-ais-huge-carbon-footprint/). 

Here below there is a collection of resources that can help framing the problem.
