# Can AI help science?

Can AI help science? in my opinion yes, and it can do it in several directions. This week I found two interesting examples that showcase the potential of AI to foster creativity and productivity in science.

1 - AI can help writing equations that push scientific discovery further. 

AI Hilbert is an aLgorithm that that can generate and derive new equations from a combination of existing theory and data, with the goal of filling in gaps in scientific knowledge, including introducing new theories.  The toold is based on multivariate polynomial expressions and is aimed at physic theory. The main goal is to augment the scientific method in contexts where collecting data can be expensive or noisy, data-driven models can be overly rigid, and where "traditional" AI would generate equations that can be poorly generalizable.

This is a major advancement for areas where the scientific discovery has been stagnating (See for example, research from @Prof.Arora and co-authors: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/smj.2693).

2- AI can help with scientific literature understanding. 

Scientists build their knowledge on the existing work and reading the existing scientific literature is a fundamental step. There are several ready-to-use AI-based tools on the market, but the common problem in using AI for literature reviews arise when semantics for each discipline can be very different, specific jargon may not be captured LLMs and researchers receive hallucinated answers.

SciLitLLM is a suite of LLMs presenting promising results in specialized in scientific literaure understanding. It is build on a hybrid approach that combines both continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help adapting to different domains and to infuse instructions for domain-specific tasks. 

This tool can help scientists extract targeted information, summarize a large corpus from a stack of documents, and speed up search through the literature. Note that it won't substitute the researchers' critical reading and understanding of such knowledge.

While I am very excited to read about these novel ways AI can help scientists to produce new innovation, there are some caveats. Among all, these examples are not plug-and-play tools that researchers can directly use for their job and they require some programming skills to be customized to the scientists' needs. It looks it still require time, trust from the scientific community, and investments the institutions to make these investions ready to be consumed by the majority of the scientists. 

For those working in resarch and science, I am curios to hear your opinion!
